# SkeleOS

SkeleOS was a project I experimented with when I was learning web development. The aim was to simulate an OS in a browser. Although not very useful as there are browser and JavaScript limitations, it serves as a fun project to experiment with. Feel free to clone and experiment it. 

Try it live at: [https://javascriptaddict.github.io/SkeleOS/](https://javascriptaddict.github.io/SkeleOS/ "SkeleOS")
## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JavascriptAddict/SkeleOS.git
```
```javascript
## Usage
Use Visual Studio Live Server to run it. It is fully front-end like a web page.
```
## Modules
Modules can be created  to simulate an application in an OS. The Browser module has already been created and you may use that as a template if needed.
